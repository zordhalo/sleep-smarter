  title: 'Sleep Smarter: 4 Quick Wins for Better Focus and Memory'
  subtitle: Evidence-Based Strategies for Academic Success
  hook_question: 'It''s the night before your midterm. Do you:'
  options:
  - A) Stay up until 2am cramming?
  - B) Go to sleep at midnight?
  key_stat_label: 'The Research Answer:'
  key_stat: Every hour of lost sleep = 0.07 GPA decrease

  type: two_systems
  title: 'How Sleep Works: Two Key Systems'
  system_1:
    name: Sleep Pressure (Adenosine)
    points:
    - Builds up while you're awake
    - Creates 'sleepiness' sensation
    - Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors temporarily
  system_2:
    name: Circadian Rhythm (Internal Clock)
    points:
    - 24-hour cycle controlled by light
    - Morning light → earlier sleep
    - Evening light → delayed sleep
  cognitive_cost:
    title: 'The Cognitive Cost:'
    points:
    - Sleep <6h = 20% ↓ memory, 23% ↓ concentration
    - Sleep after learning = 20-40% ↑ memory retention

  title: Four Quick Wins
  wins:
  - number: 1
    icon: ☕
    title: Caffeine Timing
    recommendation: Stop 8-12h before bed
    detail: For 10pm sleep → no caffeine after 10am-2pm
    evidence: 400mg within 12h of bed = major sleep disruption (Oxford, 2025)
    mechanism: Half-life 5-6 hours
  - number: 2
    icon: 😴
    title: Strategic Naps
    recommendation: 10-30 min, early afternoon
    detail: Before 3pm only
    evidence: 10-60min naps → ↑ mood & alertness up to 4h (Oxford, 2023)
    mechanism: 30min optimal for memory encoding
  - number: 3
    icon: 🌞
    title: Light Exposure
    recommendation: 'Morning: 5-30min outdoor light'
    detail: 'Evening: Dim lights, reduce screens'
    evidence: Morning light → ~1h/day circadian advance (Oxford, 2015)
    mechanism: Blue light at night → 30-90min melatonin delay (Heo et al., 2023)
  - number: 4
    icon: 🕐
    title: Sleep Consistency
    recommendation: Same wake time daily
    detail: 20min wind-down routine
    evidence: Irregular sleep = 2-3h circadian delay + lower GPA (Phillips et al.,
      2017)
    mechanism: Consistency matters as much as duration

slide_4:
  type: challenge
  title: 3-Day Mini-Challenge
  days:
  - day: Day 1 (Tonight)
    icon: ⏰
    tasks:
    - Set caffeine cutoff alarm (8-12h before bed)
    - 20-min screen-free wind-down
  - day: Day 2 (Tomorrow)
    icon: ☀️
    tasks:
    - 5-min morning light exposure
    - Same wake time as Day 1
    - Optional 15-min nap (before 3pm)
  - day: Day 3
    icon: 🔁
    tasks:
    - Repeat morning light + wind-down
    - Notice the difference
  benefits:
    title: 'Expected Benefits:'
    items:
    - Faster sleep onset
    - Better focus & attention
    - Improved mood & energy
    - Stronger memory encoding
